# Polygon Bazooka (name is subject to change)

**Polygon Bazooka** is a stacking game similar to [Puyo Puyo Puzzle Pop](https://www.google.com/search?q=puyo+puyo+puzzle+pop) that I started a while ago in Java, with the intent to have something to use my implementation of the [Glicko-2](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf).
Currently, all game assets are created by [Machi](https://x.com/marblechese).

This is a rewrite of the game, using the [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework) in C#.


## See also: [monogame branch](https://github.com/BlastyTheDev/PolygonBazooka/tree/monogame)
Newer, MonoGame port. Will supersede the osu!framework version.


## Platforms
Planned support for:
- Windows (probably 10 and above)
- Linux (specifically [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), as the game is being developed on it)
- Web (by WebAssembly)

MacOS will probably be supported, however, I will not make an effort to compile for MacOS if it is not possible for me.

Mobile support is **not planned**.
